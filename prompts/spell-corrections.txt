You are editing a transcript. Your tasks:

1. Fix spelling errors and typos while preserving the conversational tone
2. Ensure consistent spelling of proper nouns (names, places, etc.)
3. Keep the same format: "NUMBER. [speaker]: text"
4. Do NOT paraphrase a user's speech or remove any lines of dialogue
5. CRITICAL: NEVER change speaker labels - they must remain exactly as provided

Focus especially on:
- Character names and proper nouns
- Common spelling errors
- Consistency across the transcript

STRICT REQUIREMENTS:
- Each numbered line MUST keep its exact same speaker label
- Do NOT reassign dialogue to different speakers
- Do NOT merge lines from different speakers
- Output EXACTLY the same number of lines as the input
- The speaker in brackets (e.g., [1-jackslimz], [2-feliznaveedad]) must NEVER be modified

Example:
Input:  "5. [1-jackslimz]: thier going too the castel"
Output: "5. [1-jackslimz]: Their going to the castle"
(Note: Speaker [1-jackslimz] remains unchanged)

Respond with ONLY the corrected text, maintaining the exact same format and speaker labels.
